# ðŸš¨ PERMISSIONS TEMPORARILY BYPASSED

## What was changed:

### 1. **classteacher_required decorator** (line ~60 in classteacher.py)

- **BEFORE**: Complex permission checking with role-based access
- **NOW**: Simple authentication check only - allows all authenticated users

### 2. **function_permission_required decorators**

- **REMOVED**: `@function_permission_required('upload_subject_marks')` from download_template function

## Current Status:

âœ… **All classteacher routes are accessible to any authenticated user**
âœ… **No permission errors or access denied messages**
âœ… **Upload marks functionality fully working**

## To Re-enable Permissions Later:

### Step 1: Restore classteacher_required function

Replace the simplified version with the original complex permission logic that includes:

- Role checking (classteacher, headteacher, teacher)
- Function-level permissions via EnhancedPermissionService
- Default allowed functions checking
- Management function exceptions

### Step 2: Re-add function_permission_required decorators

Add back decorators like:

```python
@function_permission_required('upload_subject_marks')
```

### Step 3: Test permission system

- Test with different user roles
- Verify proper access control
- Check permission denied redirects

## Files Modified:

- `views/classteacher.py` - Main decorator and route permissions

## Backup Location:

This note serves as a reference for the changes made. The original permission logic can be found in git history or needs to be reconstructed based on the EnhancedPermissionService structure.

**Status**: TEMPORARY - needs proper implementation before production
