### 1. Gmail Configuration (Required for Email Features)

To enable email notifications, you need to set up Gmail SMTP:

3. Go to "App passwords" section
4. Generate a new app password for "Mail"

#### Step 2: Set Environment Variables
Create a `.env` file in your project root or set these environment variables:

```bash
# Gmail Configuration
export GMAIL_USERNAME="your-school-email@gmail.com"
export GMAIL_APP_PASSWORD="your-16-character-app-password"
```

**For Windows:**
```cmd
set GMAIL_USERNAME=your-school-email@gmail.com
set GMAIL_APP_PASSWORD=your-16-character-app-password
```

### 2. Application Restart
