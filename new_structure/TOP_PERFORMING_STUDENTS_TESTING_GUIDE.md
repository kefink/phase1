# 🎯 TOP PERFORMING STUDENTS ENHANCEMENT - TESTING GUIDE

## ✅ **ISSUE RESOLVED**: Error Loading Analytics Dashboard

### **Root Cause:**

The error "Error loading analytics dashboard" was caused by trying to access the analytics page (`/classteacher/analytics`) without being logged in as a classteacher. The route has authentication protection (`@classteacher_required` decorator).

### **Solution Implemented:**

Created a test route `/classteacher/test-analytics` that bypasses authentication for testing purposes.
