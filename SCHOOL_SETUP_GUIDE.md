## üõ†Ô∏è Technical Implementation

### Service Layer Integration
```python
# Get school information anywhere in the application
from services.school_config_service import SchoolConfigService

school_name = SchoolConfigService.get_school_name()
logo_path = SchoolConfigService.get_school_logo_path()
school_info = SchoolConfigService.get_school_info_dict()
```

### Template Integration
```html
<!-- School data available in all templates -->
<h1>{{ school_info.school_name }}</h1>
<img src="{{ school_info.logo_path }}" alt="School Logo">
<p style="color: {{ school_info.primary_color }}">Welcome</p>
```

### Database Access
```python
# Direct model access
from models.school_setup import SchoolSetup

setup = SchoolSetup.get_current_setup()
is_completed = setup.setup_completed
progress = setup.get_setup_progress()
```

## üîê Security & Permissions

### Access Control
- **Headteacher Only**: Full setup access and modification rights
- **Admin Users**: Read-only access to school information
- **Teachers**: No direct access to setup configuration

### Data Validation
- **Required Fields**: Essential information validation
- **Format Checking**: Email, phone, URL validation
- **File Upload**: Secure logo and image handling
- **SQL Injection**: Parameterized queries throughout

## üì± Multi-School Deployment

### Deployment Strategy
1. **Single Codebase**: One application serves multiple schools
2. **Database Separation**: Each school has isolated data
3. **Configuration Management**: School-specific settings
4. **Branding Isolation**: Unique visual identity per school

### Scaling Considerations
- **Database Optimization**: Indexed school_id fields
- **Caching Strategy**: School-specific cache keys
- **File Management**: Organized logo and asset storage
- **Performance**: Optimized queries for multi-tenant access

## üéØ Next Steps

After completing school setup:

1. **Staff Management**: Add teachers and administrative staff
2. **Student Enrollment**: Import or add student records
3. **Class Organization**: Set up grades, streams, and subjects
4. **Assessment Configuration**: Define assessment types and schedules
5. **Report Templates**: Customize report formats
6. **Analytics Setup**: Configure performance tracking
7. **Parent Portal**: Enable parent access if desired

## üÜò Troubleshooting
